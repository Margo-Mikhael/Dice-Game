# Dice Game

This is a fun and simple **Dice Game** where players roll dice, and the highest number wins! The game is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide an interactive and engaging experience.

## How It Works

- Two players take turns rolling the dice.
- The player with the higher roll wins the round.
- The game is styled for a clean and minimalist look.

This project is perfect for practicing basic DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic.
